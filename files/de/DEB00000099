    "+synopsis": "This Act expands the rules governing lot rent increases.  Existing law simply requires that a community owner provide 60 days written notice of an increase and that only 1 increase may be made per calendar year.  In addition to these provisions, this Act requires that rent be reasonable and be related to the operating costs and market conditions associated with maintaining the manufactured home community within which the lot is situated.\nWhen a lot rent increase is proposed, this Act mandates that the home owners or their association have the opportunity to meet with the community owner or his or her representative to discuss the reasons for the increase and the possibility of a phase-in of the increase.\nIf, following this meeting, the home owner or association is still not satisfied that the rent is reasonable and related to the operating costs and market conditions associated with maintaining the manufactured home community within which the lot is situated, either may petition to Governor\u2019s Council on Manufactured Housing to appoint a mediator.  Mediation is a non-binding process intended: 1 - to be an informal and non-adversarial process; 2 - to promote discussion among all parties relating to disputes over lot rent increases; 3 - to provide explanations regarding why a proposed lot rent is or is not reasonable, or does or does not reflect the operational costs and market conditions associated with maintaining the manufactured home community within which the lot is situated; and 4 - to facilitate a settlement of the disputed issues to the satisfaction of the parties involved.\nIf, following mediation, one of the parties remains aggrieved by the determinations of the mediator, that party may petition the Justice of the Peace Court for the appointment of an arbiter, who shall be an attorney with an expertise in landlord/tenant law and the laws governing manufactured home communities, to consider matters left unresolved following mediation or to determine whether the proposed lot rent is or is not reasonable, or does or does not reflect the operational costs and market conditions associated with maintaining the manufactured home community within which the lot is situated.  Arbitration is binding upon the parties and is a more formal proceeding.  As with mediations, parties do not need to be represented by counsel, but may be if they choose.\nUpon the conclusion of arbitration proceedings, the arbiter shall produce his or her decision, findings of facts and conclusions of law in the form of an opinion letter to the parties.  Within 20 days following the conclusion of arbitration proceedings conducted pursuant to this subsection, an aggrieved party may appeal the matter to the Superior Court on the record to review the arbiter\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and to determine whether the arbiter abused his or her discretion.\nPursuant to this Act:\nLot rent that exceeds existing market conditions for the lot by more than the national average rate of inflation for the period during which the rent is due shall be presumed unreasonable.  This presumption may be rebutted upon a showing that operational costs beyond the control of the manufacture home community owner which are associated with the specific rental lot, or the community within which the lot is situated, necessitate lot rent at the proposed level. - and - \nMarket conditions associated with maintaining the manufactured home community within which the lot is situated are determined by considering market forces absent an unequal bargaining position between manufactured home community owners and manufactured home owners (such as when a single management organization or association owns or operates multiple communities within the same geographic area) and by comparing lot rents at manufactured home communities in the competitive market that offer similar facilities, services, and amenities.  A competitive market shall be defined as communities that fall within a specific geographic area where taxes, average household income, zoning, and county or state development plans are within a predetermined standard deviation. - and -\nOperational costs associated with maintaining the manufactured home community within which the lot is situated are determined by examining the financial, utility, tax, and maintenance records of the individual manufactured home community and rental lot in question.\nThis Act focuses on lot rent increases and their justification given market conditions and operational costs.  It is intended to ensure that rents are reasonable and that home owners have the opportunity to be heard before they are established.",
