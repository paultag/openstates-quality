    "+synopsis": "This resolution is in response to recommendations from Delaware\u2019s Youth Advisory Council, which is comprised of youth who have experienced foster care and who speak on behalf of all youth in care. The Youth Advisory Council provides the opportunity for youth, who are sincere about improving foster care, to assemble and discuss issues and possible solutions.  The Youth Advisory Council members, in collaboration with the Delaware Youth Opportunities Initiative, have asked the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families and the General Assembly to consider creating a developmentally appropriate foster care program for youth/young adults up to the age of 21 to assist with their successful transition to adulthood.  This resolution requires significant youth participation in submitting a timely analysis and report on the practical and fiscal impacts of extending Delaware\u2019s foster care program to age 21.",
