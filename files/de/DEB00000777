The Board of Correction was eliminated in 1964 and its responsibilities were shifted to the Department of Correction, however the numerous references to the Board of Correction were not eliminated at that time.\u00a0This Bill replaces outdated or inaccurate terminology with the appropriate identities of the Bureaus of the Department of Correction and removes outdated terminology and defunct entities from the Code.  This Bill also removes a reference to the defunct entity \u201cCouncil on Administration of Justice\u201d and substitutes the Criminal Justice Council in its place as the appointing authority for 3 individuals on the IRCB.  This Bill also updates provisions of the Code that are no longer accurate or routinely used, to clarify the process for criminal background screening for prospective employees and eliminate the dated reference to surety bonds for the Commissioner and other Department employees.", "versions": [{"url": "http://www.legis.delaware.gov/LIS/lis146.nsf/vwLegislation/SB+245/$file/legis.html?open", "mimetype": "text/html", "+source": "http://legis.delaware.gov/LIS/lis146.nsf/2bede841c6272c888025698400433a04/859e5d09258ce2e385257a14006675f9?OpenDocument", "doc_id": "DED00002698", "name": "introduced"}, {"url": "http://www.legis.delaware.gov/LIS/lis146.nsf/vwLegislation/SB+245/$file/0781460287.docx?open", "mimetype": "application/msword", "+source": "http://legis.delaware.gov/LIS/lis146.nsf/2bede841c6272c888025698400433a04/859e5d09258ce2e385257a14006675f9?OpenDocument", "doc_id": "DED00002699", "name": "introduced"}], "type": ["bill"], "id": "DEB00000777", "bill_id": "SB 245"}
