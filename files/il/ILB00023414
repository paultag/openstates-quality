    "+synopsis": "Amends the Counties Code and the Rental Housing Support Program Act. Removes language requiring one dollar of each surcharge to be retained by the county in which it was collected and deposited into the county's general revenue fund. Provides that each recorder shall submit the surcharges (rather than $9 of each surcharge) collected in the preceding month to the Department of Revenue and the Department shall deposit these amounts in the Rental Housing Support Program Fund. Adds a severability clause to the Rental Housing Support Program Act. Effective immediately.",
