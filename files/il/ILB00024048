Provides that the General Assembly finds that the State depends upon public and private service providers to deliver many critical human services necessary to protect and enhance the welfare of its citizens, including its most vulnerable populations; that the citizens of Illinois and their communities depend upon these services to protect public health, create individual and family well-being, improve public safety, revitalize local economies, and enhance learning; and that a strong and well-managed network of public and private human services is integral to the achievement of other State goals in the areas of health and wellness, educational outcomes, workforce development, and an improved business climate. Creates the Illinois Human Services Commission to undertake a systematic review of human services programs with the goal of ensuring their consistent delivery in the State. Requires the Commission to make recommendations for achieving a system that will provide for the efficient and effective delivery of high quality human services.
