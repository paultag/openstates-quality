Creates the Illinois Human Services Commission to undertake a systematic review of human services programs with the goal of ensuring their consistent delivery in the State. Requires the Commission to make recommendations for achieving a system that will provide for the efficient and effective delivery of high quality human services. Contains provisions concerning Commission recommendations and best efforts; Commission membership and appointments; reporting requirements; and transparency.", "versions": [{"url": "http://ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=09700HB5591&GA=97&SessionId=84&DocTypeId=HB&LegID=66059&DocNum=5591&GAID=11&Session=&print=true", "doc_id": "ILD00053456", "name": "Introduced"}], "type": ["bill"], "id": "ILB00024048", "bill_id": "HB 5591"}
