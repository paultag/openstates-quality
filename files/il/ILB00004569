Provides that each school board must not make available food containing industrially produced trans fat or use food containing industrially produced trans fat in the preparation of a food item served to students from any source, including, but not limited to, school stores, school vending machines, school cafeterias, school food service establishments, and fundraising activities on school premises, whether or not school sponsored. Provides that the prohibition applies to all food and beverages sold on school grounds during the regular and extended school day, but does not apply to food provided through a United States Department of Agriculture meal program. Requires the State Board of Education to establish a procedure for monitoring compliance by school boards, and allows the State Board to establish appropriate penalties based on failure to comply.",
