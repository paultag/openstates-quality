    "+synopsis": "Amends the Common Interest Community Association Act. Provides that the board of directors of a common interest community association has the authority to revise all severed community instruments independent of the membership. Provides that no action to incorporate a common interest community as a municipality shall begin until two-thirds of the members sign an incorporation document. Provides that routine scheduled elections (instead of annual elections) shall be held for the board of managers or the board of directors. Provides for the elimination of voting by proxy in elections. Provides that if there are multiple owners of a single unit only one of the multiple owners is eligible to serve as a board member at any one time, unless the member owns another unit independently. Provides that the Board shall approve a budget including reserves, capital expenses, and operating expenses which shall be assessed equally to the membership. Provides that if total common expenses exceed the budget, the board shall disclose this to all members and identify subsequent assessments that will be made to offset this variance in future budgets. Provides that assessments for additions and alterations to common areas or to association-owned property not in the budget, shall be separately assessed and are subject to approval of a simple majority (instead of two-thirds) of the total members at a meeting called for that purpose. Makes other changes.",
