Provides that the Department may, with regard to any license, refuse to issue or renew or may revoke, suspend, place on probation, reprimand or take other disciplinary or non-disciplinary action as the Department may deem proper, including imposing fines not to exceed $10,000 (instead of $1,000) per violation, for any one or any combination of specified offenses. Creates a provision concerning the confidentiality of all information collected by the Department in the course of an examination or investigation of a licensee or applicant. Repeals provisions concerning transition and deposit of fees and fines. Makes other changes.
