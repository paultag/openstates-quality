Creates the offense of false personation of a peace officer while serving process. Provides that a person commits the offense when he or she, not being a peace officer, knowingly wears a coat, hat, or other clothing while serving process that reasonably creates the impression that the person is a peace officer. Amends the Code of Civil Procedure. With respect to the requirement that a person who is a licensed or registered private detective or a registered employee of a private detective agency must supply the sheriff of any county in which the person serves process with a copy of the person's license or certificate, deletes language providing that the failure of a person to supply a copy of the license or certificate to the sheriff does not impair the validity of process served by the person. In a provision that allows a court to appoint a certified private detective agency as a special process server, deletes language allowing any employee of the private detective agency to serve the process under the appointment.", "subjects": [], "level": "state", "type": ["bill"], "id": "ILB00004790", "bill_id": "HB 1460"}
