    "+synopsis": "Amends the School Code. Makes changes in provisions concerning General Assembly scholarships. Changes references from \"scholarship\" to \"tuition grant\". Allows each member of the General Assembly to nominate annually one person (instead of 2 persons) from his or her district to receive a tuition grant for a State university. Provides that General Assembly tuition grants are subject to appropriation (now, General Assembly scholarships exempt the holder from the payment of tuition and fees). Provides that each fiscal year, grant funds may be awarded to recipients only if this State is no more than 60 days late in payments it owes to State universities and those total payments do not exceed $50 million, as certified by the Auditor General. Provides that tuition grant funds shall be paid to State universities on behalf of the recipients. Effective immediately.",
