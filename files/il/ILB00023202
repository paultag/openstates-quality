Provides that prior to issuance of a certificate of title, a homemade trailer must be inspected by a Secretary of State employee (instead of by a Secretary of State investigator). Provides that the Secretary may issue a dealer lien release certificate of title for a fee of $20, provided certain conditions are met.

Increases the fine for operating a business after having failed to obtain a license from $300 to $500 per day. Increases the fine for operating a business with a revoked, suspended, denied, or cancelled license from $500 to $1000 per day. Provides that instead of filing a criminal complaint against an entity licensed by the Secretary, a Secretary of State Police investigator may issue administrative citations for violations of statutes or rules concerning dealers, transporters, wreckers and rebuilders. Contains procedural requirements concerning the issuance of administrative citations. Provides that the penalty imposed by issuance of an administrative citation shall not exceed $50 per violation. Provides that penalties paid as a result of the issuance of administrative citations shall be deposited in the Secretary of State Police Services Fund. Effective immediately.",
