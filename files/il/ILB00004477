Provides that, upon being furnished with a notice of violation, a violator may not, without the written consent of an investigator or law enforcement official, intentionally relocate an animal from the property where the violator resides or the property where the violation occurred, unless (i) doing so is necessary to render veterinary care to the animal or to protect the animal from an imminent disaster or emergency or (ii) the case against the violator has been closed. Defines \"relocate an animal\". Authorizes Department of Agriculture investigators and approved humane investigators to seek compensation from a violator for medical expenses incurred as a result of the investigation of a founded complaint. Provides that, once an animal is the subject of a notice of violation or impoundment, the violator or individual caring for the animal that is the subject of the notice must, until the closure of the case, present the animal to any investigator or law enforcement official who, in the course of conducting the investigation, deems it necessary to examine the animal.
