Provides that to the extent that the governing documents of a common interest community or a master association provide for lien rights and the applicability of forcible entry provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, the purchaser of a unit in a common interest community or master association at a judicial foreclosure sale, other than a mortgagee, who takes possession of a unit pursuant to a court order or a purchaser who acquires title from a mortgagee has the duty to pay the proportionate share, if any, of the common expenses for the unit which would have become due in the absence of any assessment acceleration during the 6 months immediately preceding the commencement of an action to collect the unpaid assessments. Provides that if the outstanding assessments are paid at any time during a collection action, the purchaser shall have no obligation to pay any assessments which accrued before he or she acquired title. Provides that this does not create a statutory lien in favor of the common interest community or master association.",
