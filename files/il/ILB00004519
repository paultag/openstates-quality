Repeals a provision requiring the housing authorities to submit these statements to their respective city councils not later than three months following the close of the preceding fiscal year of the authorities. Provides that exemptions to federal, State, or local requirements may be granted to a Housing Authority in the form of Waivers, Exclusions, Public Notices, Executive Orders, or moving to Work Agreements approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Makes a provision concerning tenant-income exclusions inapplicable to specified Housing programs. Makes other changes.
