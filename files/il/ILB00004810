    "+synopsis": "Amends the Illinois Public Aid Code. Provides that the Secretary of Human Services shall seek a waiver from the United States Department of Agriculture to allow the State to specify certain foods that may and may not be purchased in Illinois with the benefits funded by the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly known as the Food Stamps Program), including a general ban on the use of SNAP benefits to purchase foods of minimal nutritional value such as carbonated soft drinks, snack cakes, candies, chewing gum, flavored ice bars, and fried, high-fat chips. Requires the Secretary to consult with members of the General Assembly in developing the waiver and to obtain approval from the General Assembly before implementing the waiver. Further provides that, in order to use a LINK card to obtain SNAP benefits or cash, the user must show a current and valid photo identification. Prohibits such use of a LINK card if the name on the photo identification does not match the name on the LINK card or if the photo does not match the user of the card. Provides that every LINK card issued on or after the effective date of the amendatory Act must include on its face the name of every household member entitled to use the card.",
