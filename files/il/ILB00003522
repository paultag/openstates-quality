    "+synopsis": "Amends the Stalking No Contact Order Act, the Civil No Contact Order Act, and the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986 to provide that under no circumstances shall a stalking no contact order, civil no contact order, or order of protection require a school district to prohibit entrance of a respondent student where the respondent student is the recipient of special education services pursuant to an individualized education plan. Provides that no stalking no contact order, civil no contact order, or order of protection may require a change in placement or a material change in services for either the petitioner or respondent student under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the School Code. Provides that federal and State law regarding special education and related services prevail in the event of a conflict with an order under any of the Acts. Provides that where a respondent student subject to an order under any of the Acts requests a transfer to another school within the district, then the district may, in its sole discretion, transfer the student to another school. Provides that the choice of school to which a respondent student is transferred is at the sole discretion of the district. Provides that no district violates an order under any of the Acts for permitting a respondent student to attend a school in the district where the student is a properly enrolled student.",

Provides that no stalking no contact order, civil no contact order, or order of protection may require a change in placement or a material change in services for either the petitioner or respondent student under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the School Code. Provides that federal and State law regarding special education and related services prevail in the event of a conflict with an order under any of the Acts. Provides that where a respondent student subject to an order under any of the Acts requests a transfer to another school within the district, then the district may, in its sole discretion, transfer the student to another school. Provides that the choice of school to which a respondent student is transferred is at the sole discretion of the district.
