    "+synopsis": "Amends the Environmental Protection Act concerning the Site Remediation Program. Provides that certain limitations on liability and cost recovery for site remediation do not apply to sites: (i) that are subject to any remediation or remedial activity regulated under a State program authorized, approved, or delegated pursuant to any federal environmental statute or (ii) that do not qualify to participate in the Site Remediation Program. Specifies that a definition of \"remedial action\" applies only in the context of the Site Remediation Program. Provides that the Pollution Control Board may (now, \"shall\") adopt rules concerning liability for certain remedial actions following the release of a regulated substance. Provides that the Environmental Protection Agency's issuance of a No Further Remediation Letter to a site that is eligible for the Site Remediation Program (and not simply to any site) signifies a release from further remedial responsibilities. Makes other changes. Effective immediately.",
