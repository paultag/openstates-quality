Provides that portions of a declaration or the by-laws of a common interest community association that are inconsistent with the Act are void as against public policy. Deletes provision that states community instruments should be interpreted consistently with the Act's definitions, unless the context otherwise requires. Deletes provision that states that all provisions of a declaration, bylaws, and other community instruments are severable. Deletes provision stating that the terms of at least one-third of the board members expire annually and that board members are elected at large. Exempts master associations from the provision that states that two-thirds of the unit owners may remove a board member at a special meeting. Deletes exception that allows community instruments to require a quorum other than 20% of the unit owners. Exempts master associations from the finance provisions of the Act that concern separate assessments. Deletes provisions that exempted certain common interest community associations (those which: are not permitted, under their governing documents, to use litigation or arbitration to collect assessments or fines; have 10 units or less; or have annual budgeted assessments of $50,000 or less) from provisions in the Act pertaining to board meeting frequency, meeting notices, meeting procedures, and fidelity insurance.
