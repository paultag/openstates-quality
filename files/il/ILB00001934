Provides that when dogs or cats are impounded, they must be scanned using a universal scanner and be examined for all other currently acceptable methods of identification within 24 hours of intake of each animal. Provides that a mailed notice shall remain the primary means of contacting an owner of an impounded dog or cat; however, the Administrator shall also attempt to contact the owner by any other contact information provided, such as a telephone number or email address. Provides that any impounded animal be held for a minimum of 7 business days to allow reclamation by an owner, agent, or caretaker. Provides that if an animal has been microchipped and the owner on the chip cannot be located or refuses to reclaim the animal, attempt should be made to contact the previous owner named on the chip, as well as the agency or individual who purchased the chip, prior to euthanizing, transferring, or adoption. Provides that prior to euthanizing or transferring an animal, the animal shall be rescanned using a universal scanner, for the presence of a microchip and, if a microchip cannot be detected, examined for all other currently acceptable methods of identification, including, but not limited to, identification tags, tattoos, and rabies license tag. Provides for the prioritization of intake of animals from within the State prior to animals from outside the State. Effective January 1, 2012.",
