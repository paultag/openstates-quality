    "+synopsis": "Amends the Property Tax Code. In a Section concerning certificates of error in counties of less than 3,000,000, provides that no certificate of error, other than a certificate to establish tax exempt status, shall be executed for any tax year more than 3 years after the date on which the annual judgment and order of sale for that tax year was first entered. Removes a provision stating that certificates of error may be issued at any time before judgment or order of sale is entered in any proceeding to collect or to enjoin the collection of taxes based upon any assessment of any property. Effective immediately.",
