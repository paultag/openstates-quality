    "+synopsis": "Amends provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure setting forth the required contents of a forcible entry and detainer complaint. Adds language requiring a complaint filed in a county with a population of 3,000,000 or more to state, if known to the parties entitled to the possession of the premises: the name of each known occupant of the premises, along with each known occupant's date of birth and, if the actual date of birth is unknown, whether a known occupant is known to be younger than 18 years of age or 65 years of age or older; and whether a known occupant has a disability, as defined by the Disabilities Services Act of 2003, but only to the extent that the occupant has self-reported the disability to the person claiming possession. Provides that the failure to comply with the requirement to provide such information shall not affect the validity or the legal effect of any complaint or of any order or judgment entered in the action. Provides that the changes made by the amendatory Act do not apply to specified public housing programs. Effective immediately.",
