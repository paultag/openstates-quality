    "+synopsis": "Amends the Property Tax Code. In a Section concerning refunds for erroneous assessments or overpayments, provides that, in Cook County, a claim for refund is allowed if the application is filed after September 1, 2011 (instead of between September 1, 2011 and September 1, 2012) and the right to a refund arose more than 5 years prior to the date the application is filed but not earlier than January 1, 2000. Removes a provision limiting the total amount of taxes and interest that may be refunded for applications filed more than 5 years after the right to a refund arose. Effective immediately.",
