Provides that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) shall enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) which authorizes the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to enter into written agreements with a state or any political subdivision of a state to remove an alien in the custody of that state. Provides that the purpose of the MOU is to set forth terms by which ICE and IDOC will cooperate in a Rapid Removal of Eligible Parolees Accepted for Transfer (\"Rapid REPAT\") program, which allows for early conditional release for deportation of removable custodial aliens to their home countries. Provides that the MOU shall provide that a person may take part in this program only if a final order of deportation has been issued against such person. Provides that the Prisoner Review Board shall hear by at least one member and, through a panel of at least 3 members, decide all requests for release of prisoners subject to detainers filed by ICE.",
