    "+synopsis": "Amends the School Code, the Higher Education Student Assistance Act, and the Illinois Youth and Young Adult Employment Act of 1986. Provides that after July 1, 2012 persons may not be nominated for General Assembly scholarships and that General Assembly scholarships may not be awarded after that date unless the nomination is made prior to that date. Prevents both second nominations for any lapsed General Assembly scholarship and nominating persons to the unused or unexpired parts of any vacated General Assembly scholarship after July 1, 2012. Beginning with the 2012-2013 academic year, requires the Illinois Student Assistance Commission to receive and consider applications for scholarship assistance from participants in the Young Adult Component of the Illinois Conservation Corps enrolled or accepted for enrollment at a public university or community college in this State. Provides that a total of 100 scholarships shall be awarded each year. Provides that recipients shall be selected from among qualified applicants based upon academic excellence and an intent to study a natural resource or environment-related major field of study. Provides that preference may be given to previous recipients of assistance. Provides that each scholarship shall be in an amount sufficient to pay the tuition and fees of the public university or community college at which the recipient is enrolled. Requires the Commission to administer the scholarship program and make all necessary and proper rules not inconsistent with these provisions for their effective implementation. Provides that an enrollee of the Illinois Conservation Corps program shall not receive payment for work performed (instead of receiving at least the standard minimum wage) if he or she is or was a recipient of a scholarship. Effective immediately.",
