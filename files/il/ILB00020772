    "summary": "Creates the Consumer Alternatives Program Act. Directs the Department of Human Services to implement the Consumer Alternatives Program to prevent or avoid the unnecessary institutional care treatment of individuals with mental disorders or a co-occurring disorder of mental illness and substance abuse or addiction and to provide cost effective, community alternatives and supports that enable these individuals to live successfully in the community. Requires implementation of the Program during fiscal year 2013. Makes implementation of the Program dependent upon funds appropriated by the General Assembly. Provides that participants in the program may receive certain services such as a comprehensive evaluation that includes an assessment of skills, abilities, and potential for living in the community and work placement; family or individual support services; case coordination services; and vocational training. Prohibits the denial of program services because of age, sex, ethnic origin, marital status, ability to pay (except when contrary to law), degree of disability, or illness. Requires the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to assist the Department of Human Services in developing housing assistance programs aimed at promoting the ability of individuals with a mental disorder to move from institutions to the most integrated community residence. Effective July 1, 2012.",
