    "+synopsis": "Amends the Illinois Act on the Aging. Requires the Department on Aging to increase the effectiveness of the existing Community Care Program by implementing an exception process to allow an individual to exceed his or her service cost maximum, if necessary to prevent institutionalization, as determined by the individual's case coordination unit. Provides that all persons admitted to a nursing home facility who remain in the facility for a period of 30 days shall be rescreened between 30 and 45 days after admittance to assess their continuing need for nursing facility care and shall be advised of all other available care options. Provides that the Department shall establish a program to assist persons 60 years of age or older in managing their medications (rather than subject to appropriation, the Department shall establish a program to assist persons 60 years of age or older in managing their medications).",
