    "+synopsis": "Amends the Unified Code of Corrections. Provides that the Director of Corrections may not award good conduct credit for meritorious service to an inmate unless either: (1) the inmate has served a minimum of 60 days of the sentence in a secure county corrections facility or Illinois Department of Corrections facility or in both such facilities; or (2) the Director in his or her discretion determines that an award of good conduct credit for meritorious service which would permit release in advance of an inmate having served 60 days of the sentence in a secure county corrections facility or Illinois Department of Corrections facility or in both such facilities will further correctional goals without appreciably or predictably increasing risk to public safety, and would be consistent with best practices and the purposes of the Code. Establishes criteria for which an inmate may be awarded good conduct credit for meritorious service or for participation full-time in substance abuse programs, correctional industry assignments, or educational programs or for passing the GED test while incarcerated.",
