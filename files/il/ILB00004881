    "+synopsis": "Amends the Illinois Human Rights Act. With respect to real estate transactions, prohibits discrimination on the basis of source of income in relation to residential rental real estate transactions. In provisions making it is a civil rights violation for an owner or any other person engaging in a real estate transaction, or for a real estate broker or salesman, because of unlawful discrimination or familial status or source of income, to engage in certain activities, provides that those provisions do not: (i) require a housing authority or housing development project in which 25% or more of the units are owned by a housing authority or subject to a leasing agreement, regulatory and operating agreement, or other similar instrument with a housing authority to lease or rent another unit of that same housing development project to an existing or prospective tenant who is receiving subsidies, payment assistance, contributions, or vouchers under or in connection with the federal Housing Choice Voucher program for payment of part or all of the rent for the unit; (ii) require or prevent, with specified exceptions, any person whose property is located in a municipality with fewer than 1,000,000 inhabitants and is in a concentrated census tract where 3% of the total housing stock in that census tract is occupied by tenants relying on subsidies, payment assistance, contributions, or vouchers under or in connection with the federal Housing Choice Voucher program for payment of part of the rent for the unit to lease or rent a unit to a prospective tenant who is relying on such a subsidy, payment assistance, contribution, or voucher for payment of part or all of the rent for the unit (the housing authority shall determine which census tracts within its service area meet the concentrated census tract exemption requirements and annually deliver that information to the municipalities within its jurisdiction); or (iii) prevent an owner or agent from taking into consideration factors other than lawful source of income such as credit history, criminal history, or references. Makes other changes. Effective January 31, 2012.",
