    "+synopsis": "Amends the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986. Provides that, as part of a stay away order, the court, on the request of respondent or on its own motion and for good cause shown, may order petitioner to stay away from respondent, or prohibit petitioner from entering or remaining present at respondent's school, place of employment, or other specified places at times when respondent is legitimately present, or both, if reasonable. Provides that, as part of an order prohibiting abuse, neglect, or exploitation, the court, on the request of respondent or on its own motion and for good cause shown, may prohibit petitioner from harassing the respondent; for purposes of this provision \"harassment\" means knowing conduct which is not necessary to accomplish a purpose that is reasonable under the circumstances; would cause a reasonable person emotional distress; and does cause emotional distress to the respondent. Provides that a court order that prohibits a petitioner from harassing the respondent shall not be construed as a mutual order of protection.",
