Provides that, as part of an order prohibiting abuse, neglect, or exploitation, the court, on the request of respondent or on its own motion and for good cause shown, may prohibit petitioner from harassing the respondent; for purposes of this provision \"harassment\" means knowing conduct which is not necessary to accomplish a purpose that is reasonable under the circumstances; would cause a reasonable person emotional distress; and does cause emotional distress to the respondent. Provides that a court order that prohibits a petitioner from harassing the respondent shall not be construed as a mutual order of protection.", "subjects": [], "level": "state", "type": ["bill"], "id": "ILB00006375", "bill_id": "HB 3045"}
