Provides that a special service area district may not be created or enlarged, a tax may not be levied or imposed nor the rate increased, nor may bonds be issued unless that action is authorized by a petition that is signed by at least 51% of the electors residing within the special service area and by at least 51% of the owners of record of the land included within the boundaries of the special service area (currently, the action may be taken unless a petition objecting to the action is filed). Provides that, if a person who is registered to vote has died or has permanently moved from the special service area, and if certified documentation is submitted along with the authorization petition, then that person shall not be counted as an elector for purposes of the authorization petition.",
