    "+synopsis": "Amends the Property Tax Code. In a provision setting forth requirements for the issuance of a tax deed, provides that the requirement that all forfeitures and sales occurring subsequent to the tax sale must be redeemed applies only to forfeitures and sales of subsequent years' taxes. Provides that liens for delinquent taxes must be merged into the tax deed grantee's title even if the liens are included in a subsequent sale. Makes corresponding changes in a Section concerning sales in error. Provides that the amendatory Act is declarative of existing law.",
