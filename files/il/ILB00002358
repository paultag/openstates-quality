    "summary": "Amends the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act. Provides that where an historical pattern of representation exists for the workers of a private medical vendor prior to becoming certified employees under the Personnel Code, the Board shall find the labor organization that has historically represented the workers to be the exclusive representative under the Act, and shall find the unit represented by the exclusive representative to be the appropriate unit. Provides that nothing shall preclude the exclusive representative of the workers from petitioning the Illinois Labor Relations Board for unit clarification to include any or all of the employees in an existing bargaining unit or units. Amends the Unified Code of Corrections. Provides that effective July 1, 2011, all contracts between the State and outside contractors to provide workers for medical services and related support services at all facilities of the Illinois Department of Corrections or the Department of Juvenile Justice shall be amended to allow for the conversion of vendor employees performing under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement to become employees of the State of Illinois. Provides that upon amendment of the contracts, each worker or staff member employed under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement shall be offered certified employment status under the Personnel Code with the State of Illinois. Provides that the position offered to each person shall be at the same facility and shall consist of the same duties and hours as previously existed under the amended contract or contracts. Effective July 1, 2011.",
